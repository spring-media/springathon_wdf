# WELT Digital Fighters: The digital opinion battle.

For younger WELT audience and playful Karls who want to get different perspectives on a topic while learning about the personal standpoints of specific editors, WDF is an easily accessible interactive video tool – designed for mobile and enhancement of social interaction – that combines knowledge gain with enjoyable interaction by establishing a digital area where editors battle for the user support. Unlike standard video content we deliver a multi-perspective view rather than pro-con only – and combine it with interactive feedback for users and editor.
